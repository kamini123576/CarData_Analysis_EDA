**Task 1: Tagging Free Text Fields**<br>
The problem in Task 1 was to process free-text fields containing information about customer complaints, root causes, and corrective actions. 
The objective was to extract meaningful tags summarizing key failure conditions, components, and corrective measures. 
This tagging process aimed to convert unstructured data into structured, actionable insights, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify recurring patterns and areas for improvement.

**Task 2: Data Analysis and Insights Generation** <br>
The problem in Task 2 involved analyzing a structured dataset to extract actionable insights. This included performing column-wise analysis, cleaning missing and inconsistent data, identifying critical columns for stakeholder decision-making, and generating tags/features from unstructured free-text data. The goal was to ensure the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis while uncovering trends and insights that could guide quality improvements, cost optimizations, and maintenance strategies.

# Data Analysis and Insights Generation

**Problem Overview**
The objective of this task was to analyze the provided dataset and extract actionable insights by performing a series of operations, 
including column-wise analysis, data cleaning, identification of critical columns, generation of meaningful tags, 
and summarization of findings. The goal was to ensure the dataset is prepared for analysis, uncover key trends,
and provide stakeholders with useful insights for decision-making.<br>

**Dataset and Approach**<br>
**1. Column-Wise Analysis** <br>
. Each column was analyzed in terms of its data type, unique values, and distribution.<br>
. Numerical columns: Provided trends and patterns (e.g., costs, mileage).<br>
. Categorical columns: Helped identify key categories for classification (e.g., vehicle platforms, failure types).<br>

**2. Data Cleaning** <br>
. Numerical columns: Replaced with mean or median values.<br>
. Categorical columns: Filled with the mode or "Unknown."<br>
. Inconsistent data (e.g., typos, capitalization) in categorical columns was standardized using string transformations (e.g., converting all text to lowercase).<br>
. Outliers in numerical columns were handled using the IQR method to cap extreme values, ensuring they did not skew the analysis.<br>

**3. Identifying Critical Columns**<br>
The top 5 critical columns were identified based on their importance for stakeholders:<br>
. TOTALCOST: To analyze repair expenses and cost control.<br>
. KM: To understand vehicle usage patterns and their correlation with repairs.<br>
. CAUSAL_PART_NM: To identify recurring component failures.<br>
. PLATFORM: To analyze trends specific to vehicle types.<br>
. REPAIR_DATE: To identify seasonal or time-based repair patterns.<br>

**4. Generating Tags/Features from Free Text**<br>
. Free-text fields (e.g., complaints, corrections) were cleaned and tokenized.<br>
. Tags were generated using word frequency analysis, focusing on the most recurring words (e.g., "steering," "sensor," "oil").<bR>

**5. Summary and Insights** <bR>
The insights generated from the dataset included:<bR>
. Frequent failures in components like sensors, steering systems, and fuel tanks.<bR>
. Common causes like loose fittings, missing parts, and worn components.<bR>
. Key corrective actions like "replacing," "tightening," and "recalibrating."<bR>

**Analysis and Key Insights** <br>

**1. Frequent Issues:**<br>
The most common problems involved sensors and steering components, highlighting areas for quality improvement.<br>
**2. Cost Analysis:**<br>
High repair costs were associated with specific platforms and recurring issues, providing opportunities for cost optimization.<br>
**3. Time-Based Trends:**<br>
Seasonal spikes in repairs indicated the need for proactive maintenance strategies during peak times.<br>


**Conclusion** <br>
This task provided a structured approach to data analysis, enabling the generation of actionable insights for stakeholders. 
By cleaning and analyzing the dataset, identifying critical columns, and generating meaningful tags, this process offered a 
comprehensive understanding of recurring issues and trends. The insights can be used to improve product quality, reduce repair costs, 
and enhance maintenance strategies.

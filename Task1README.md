# Car Data Analysis  <bR>
**Data Tagging and Analysis** <br>

**Problem Overview**<br>
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing repair-related free-text fields (e.g., complaints, causes, corrections) and generate meaningful tags for each record. The tags summarize key failure conditions, components, and corrective actions, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify recurring issues and trends in the dataset.<br>

**Dataset Description**<br>
The dataset consists of multiple columns, including:<br>

**1. Primary Key:** Unique identifier for each record.<br>
**2. Complaint:** Free-text descriptions of the issue reported.<br>
**3. Cause:** Free-text descriptions of the root cause.<br>
**4. Correction:** Actions taken to resolve the issue.<br>
**5. Tagging Fields:** Columns for Root Cause, Symptom Condition, Symptom Component, Fix Condition, and Fix Component, which need to be populated.<br>
The dataset includes structured and unstructured data, requiring preprocessing and tagging to derive meaningful insights.<br>

**Approach**<br>

**Data Cleaning**:<br>
Removed non-alphabetic characters and standardized text to lowercase for uniformity.
Tokenized free-text fields to break them into meaningful words.<br>

**Tag Generation:** <br>
Extracted the most frequent words using word frequency analysis to identify recurring themes.<br>
Mapped these words back to the dataset as tags, categorizing records based on their content.<br>

**Analysis and Insights** <br>
**Frequent Issues:** Tags revealed that components like "steering," "sensor," and "fuel" frequently appear in complaints.<br>
**Recurring Causes:** Common causes include loose fittings, missing parts, and faulty sensors, suggesting specific areas for quality improvement.<br>
**Corrective Actions:** Actions such as "replacing," "tightening," and "cleaning" were most common, indicating repair trends.<br>

**Summary and Conclusion**<br>
This project provides a structured method to preprocess free-text data and generate meaningful tags for categorization. By leveraging word frequency analysis and logical reasoning, stakeholders can:<br>

. Quickly identify common issues and their root causes.<br>
. Optimize maintenance strategies and improve quality control. The generated tags and insights serve as a foundation for further analysis and operational decision-making.<br>
